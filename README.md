# Proteorhodopsin_Yangtze_River
This study used multi-omics approaches to explore the diversity, spatial distribution and expression profiles of proteorhodopsins (PRs) in the Yangtze River, and unraveled ecological roles of PRs in the broad-spectrum environmental adaptative strategies of PR-processing (PR+) bacteria.
